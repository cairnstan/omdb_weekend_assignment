# omdb_weekend_assignment
Use the OMDBApi to query three different movies that have had an impact on your life. You will do three seperate queries, grabbing information for each movie and appending it to the screen. Each of these elements should be styled and presented in a way that reflects the things that we've learned about CSS in the past week.

API documentation: http://www.omdbapi.com/

Hard Mode
Add jQuery animations to hide and show information about the movies.
